This is my homepage, where I store all things me, whether that is general programming, maths, game development, or something entirely random that has no bearing elsewhere on the internet but I feel is worth it here.

## What I do

I am a hobbyist programmer and indie game dev, amongst other things. My current project, *The Eastern Tower* is currently in-development, however it will be a very long time before anything comes of it (writing this webpage, for one). As for languages, I am mainly proficient in the C family, however I have also learnt a fair bit about HTML/CSS design from this webpage, and Make from extensive trial and error with trying to create a function compiling system for my C projects.
